<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

![screenshot](./src/assets/img/solution-print.png)

This project contains implementations for challenges related to creating reusable components. Here is a brief description of what has already been done:

- **[Navigation Components:](./src/app/layout/)** Footer, Sidebar and Content Container. These aren't related to any challenges, but I wanted to implement them to practice a little CSS, the result was very satisfying.
- **[Button Component:](./src/app/components/button/)** Implementation of a stylized and reusable button component for this [challenge](https://devchallenges.io/challenges/ohgVTyJCbm5OZyTB2gNY). Its implementation uses the standard Angular component structure but with some specifics, such as the `selector`, which has been modified to satisfy User Story eight: *I can still access all button attributes*.

### Built With

- [Angular](https://angular.io/)

## Features
